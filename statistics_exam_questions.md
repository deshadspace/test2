## QUESTION 2 

### a) Provide short answers: (20 Marks)

i. Provide the sample space for an event getting "exactly 2 heads" when tossing 3 unbiased coins.

ii. Let the random variable X follow a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ. Then what will be the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample mean (X̄) when the sample size is 35?

iii. A population has a μ=50 and σ=10. If these scores are transformed into z-scores, the population of z-scores will have a mean and standard deviation of:

iv. A null hypothesis of a test was accepted at 5% significant level. What will be the result of same hypothesis test at 1% significant test?

### c) Suppose the distribution of maize cob weights in a particular field is normally distributed with a mean of 250 g and a standard deviation of 40 g. If the acceptable marketable range for maize cob weight is considered to be between 230 g and 270 g, then what percentage of the harvested cobs would fall within this range? (30 Marks)

### d) A researcher is interested in whether the average body weight of a new strain of laboratory rats differs from the known population mean of 250 g. A random sample of 12 rats was weighed, and the data (in grams) were: 248, 242, 245, 249, 260, 258, 243, 251, 252, 259, 254, 256 and R output is as follows:

**One Sample t-test**

(Analyze the output and provide interpretation)

## QUESTION 3 (Box Plot and Descriptive Statistics Question)

### c) A researcher aimed to study the yield performance of a Mung bean variety under varying water level (pod per plant) for 40 Mung bean plants grown under one specific water level are given below.

**Pod yield per plant data:**

| | | | | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | 12 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 25 | 27 | 28 | 28 | 28 |
| 28 | 30 | 31 | 31 | 31 | 32 | 32 | 32 | 32 | 33 |
| 33 | 34 | 35 | 35 | 36 | 37 | 37 | 38 | 38 | 38 |
| 40 | 42 | 43 | 44 | 47 | 48 | 48 | 51 | 55 | 72 |

**Box Plot Information:**
- Q1 = 28
- Q3 = 38.5
- IQR = 10.5

i. Comment on the use of mode as a central tendency measure of the above data set.

ii. Calculate mean and standard deviation of the above data set and interpret the results.

iii. The distribution of the data is represented in the box plot below. Interpret and describe the key features illustrated in the plot.

iv. Using the 1.5*IQR rule determine whether there are any outliers in the sample of pod yield data. Justify your response.

## QUESTION 4 (Regression Analysis)

If the Pearson's Moment Correlation Coefficient (r) between Shell Length 9(cm) and Weight (kg) is 0.97, briefly describe the relationship between Shell Length and Weight of the tortoises.

**Regression Output:**

```
Coefficients:
                Estimate  Std. Error  t value  Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)     -15.6113    1.9210     -8.02   1.1e-07 ***
Shell_Length     0.0254     0.0273     30.21  < 2e-16 ***

Residual standard error: 1.021 on 18 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared: 0.980, Adjusted R-squared: 0.979
F-statistic: 912.8 on 1 and 18 DF, p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

**Weight data (kg):**
8, 11, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 43, 45, 47, 50

i. Write the multiple regression equation and interpret the slope in context.

ii. Explain what R² = 0.98 tells you about the model fit.
